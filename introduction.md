# 🎯 Introduction to Design Patterns in Java

## 💡 What Are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are **standard, reusable solutions** to common problems in software design.

A group of four authors — known as the **Gang of Four (GoF)** — documented **23 patterns** in their famous book:  
**_Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_**.

## ✅ Benefits of Using Design Patterns

- 📦 Write **modular, clean, and maintainable code**
- 🔁 Promote **code reuse** and **flexibility**
- 🧱 Follow **industry-standard practices**
- 🧠 Improve **communication** with developers (patterns = common language)
- 🧪 Make code **easier to test and refactor**
- 💼 Frequently asked in **job interviews**

## 📚 What You’ll Learn in This Series

We will explore 3 main categories of Design Patterns:

### 1. **Creational Patterns**
These deal with **object creation mechanisms**, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

### 2. **Structural Patterns**
These deal with **object composition** — how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### 3. **Behavioral Patterns**
These focus on **communication between objects**.

- Strategy
- Observer
- Command
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- State
- Template Method
- Visitor
- Chain of Responsibility
